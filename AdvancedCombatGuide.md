There are four styles of combat that you can choose to do: melee, ranged, magic, or hybrid. Melee makes use
of melee weapons (such as scimitars and daggers). Ranged makes use of ranged weapons (such as longbows and
crossbows). Magic makes use of magic weapons (such as staffs and wands). Hybrid utilizes 2 or more of the
above skills with weapons that provide hybrid statistics (such as Shapeless Scythe)
# Player, Equipment Stats, and Skills
Both your equipment and your skill levels decide how effective you are in combat. You must know how they
work in order to make effective loadouts. Combat is broken into six skills, each with their own experience and how to earn it.
Constitution: Earned when other Combat experience is earned.
Attack: Landing hits in Combat.
Defense: Taking, mitigating and dodging damage in Combat.
Strength: Dealing damage with Melee related skills.
Magic: Dealing damage with Magic related skills.
Ranged: Dealing damage with Ranged related skills.
Experience for each combat skill is rewarded on monster kill, so dying before defeating a mob will reward no experience.

## The Offensive Stats
<b>Strength</b> (Melee), <b>Dexterity</b> (Ranged), and <b>Intelligence</b> (Magic) are the main offensive
stats and modify your overall damage for their respective fields. They are also affected by Combat Skill
Levels (<b>Strength</b>, <b>Ranged</b>, and <b>Magic</b>). <br />
<b>Crit Chance</b> is your chance to hit an enemy for Critical damage, when you do hit a crit, it'll add
damage based off your <b>Crit Multiplier</b>. Having a Crit Chance of 30% and a Crit Mult of 50% means that
you have a 30% chance on hit to do 50% more damage. <br />
<b>Accuracy</b> is what decides your hit chance against the enemy. There are several different types of
accuracy, where the types of abilities you use will be affected by those. For example the ability 'Fireball'
will make use of Magic Accuracy and Fire Accuracy.

## The Defensive Stats
<b>Protection</b> is your physical damage reduction. Any melee or ranged damage that an enemy hits you with
will be reduced using this value. <br />
<b>Resistance</b> is your magic damage reduction. Any magic damage that an enemy hits you with will be
reduced using this value. <br />
<b>Agility</b> is used to calculate your dodge chance. The higher this value is, the less likely it is that
an enemy will be able to hit you. <br />
<b>Stamina</b> determines the value of your total health, in addition to your <b>Constitution</b> level
## Affinities
Affinities are used in calculating your effectiveness for each subclass of combat, both for offense and
defense. A good example of this are Breatplates, which give a high amount of negative offensive affinities,
but lots of positive defensive affinities in return. This makes them very effective at tanking, but not good
at outputting damage. Affinities are added together from item to item (ex. a fire amulet provides +15% fire
affinity, which would be added with the +35% fire affinity given by the Mantle of Flame to give a total fire
affinity of +50%). Affinities can increase or decrease your total effectiveness in combat, but not as
drastically as it first seems. Each ability used takes an average of all styles used in an ability.
<br />
Player Stats: +50% magic affinity, +215% fire affinity
<br />
Ability Being Used: Fireball (1x Magic, 1.33x Fire) {abilityIcon(abilitiesIds.fire_ball)}
<br />
(MagicAffinity x AbilityMagicMultiplier + FireAffinity x AbilityFireMultiplier) / AffinityTypeCount
<br />
↓↓
<br />
PlayerDamageEffectiveness = (1.00 x 1.50 + 1.33 x 2.15) / 2 = 2.179
<br />
Damage = AbilityDamage x (PlayerDamageEffectiveness / EnemyDefenseEffectiveness)
